# Nifty_TRI_scrapper
WebScrapper_Project

1. Developed a script to navigate to the target webpage and select the necessary options using Selenium.
2. Implemented functions to choose the desired index type such as "Equity TRI," and performed the required actions for selection.
3. Created functions to pick start dates for data extraction, including handling date selection using datepicker widgets.i found that end date selection is difficult to handle as it shares the same path as startdate.
4. Enhanced the script to iterate through various index values and retrieve historical data for each iteration.
5. End output is the print of dates and TRI values of each and every nifty TRI index.
6. Make sure to change the drive_path to your chrome driver in the code. the selection of start day is a bit tricky. So, one has to choose row number and column number from the calendar the app throws.
